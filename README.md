Embark on a visual journey through the world of cutting-edge CSS techniques and modern design with my Behance portfolio project, crafted under the guidance of the exceptional "Advanced CSS and Sass" course by instructor Jonas Schmedtmann. This meticulously curated course delves into the intricacies of advanced CSS, covering everything from Flexbox and CSS Grid to animations, Sass, and responsive design.

In this showcase, witness the application of complex CSS animations using @keyframes, the utilization of advanced selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements, and gain insights into the inner workings of CSS, including the cascade, specificity, and inheritance. Explore the principles of CSS architecture, delve into the power of Sass with variables and mixins, and navigate the NPM ecosystem for efficient development workflows.

The project demonstrates mastery in responsive design, featuring fluid grids, flexible images, and responsive workflows. Experience the magic of SVG images and videos seamlessly integrated into the HTML and CSS, along with the implementation of flexbox and CSS Grid layouts in a real-world context.
